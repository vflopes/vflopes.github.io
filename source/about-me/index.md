I was born in September 1994 in a small town in the interior of Rio de Janeiro (Brazil). As a child I always had an instinct to explore the unknown. My mother says the toys I liked best were workshop tools (and this was stimulated by my father being an electrical engineer). I liked to leaf through encyclopedias even though I could not read, seeing the figures and creating my experiments.

I think my journey with technology started when my parents gave me my first game console: Mega Drive. I started thinking about how I could do my games. I then began to study programming and discovered in what galaxy the universe of knowledge I was: IT.

Many years passed, I moved to Sao Paulo alone to begin my journey in search of my dreams. My passion for technology always increases, in a parallel world I would be immortal to take time to learn about all areas.

### Why "code ronin"?

Well, I don't have formal superior education, but I in my skill bars "self-taught" is overpowered. I am a tech guy with ninja skills.

### But what is your goal?

My goal is to grow as an IT guy creating business that delivers well-crafted services from business planning to software architecture and programming. I know most think that you should specialize as a people manager or specialist, I think it is possible to have a specialist heart and eyes for business and let every half of the brain process each one.

I need two things to be motivated with one goal: challenge and rewards. Self-indulgence bothers me, I do not want to do more of the same, that explains the challenge. And achieving a goal that has no merit does not create energy, that explains the rewardss.

### What you don't want to learn?

Because our life span is limited, we have to dedicate our time to what we want and dream about. The list below does not say what I do not like, it just says about what I do not want to take time to learn:

* Java
* Ruby
* Python
* IBM, Microsoft and Oracle entreprise things

### Are you evaluating new opportunities?

I am always evaluating new opportunities, for business, projects, job vacancies. Just remember what I said about my profile: challenge and rewards. Not "I trade six for a half dozen," an opportunity always has to be better than my current situation.

Of course, for open-source projects we have our personal motivations and not necessarily you need to show me that it's worth, I discover the value of the solution understanding the project proposal.
