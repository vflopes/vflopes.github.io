        <p>I was born in September 1994 in a small town in the interior of Rio de Janeiro (Brazil). As a child I always had an instinct to explore the unknown. My mother says the toys I liked best were workshop tools (and this was stimulated by my father being an electrical engineer). I liked to leaf through encyclopedias even though I could not read, seeing the figures and creating my experiments.</p>
<p>I think my journey with technology started when my parents gave me my first game console: Mega Drive. I started thinking about how I could do my games. Then I began to study programming and discovered in what galaxy the universe of knowledge I was: IT.</p>
<p>Many years passed, I moved to Sao Paulo alone to begin my journey in search of my dreams. My passion for technology always increases, in a parallel world I would be immortal to take time to learn about all areas.</p>
<hr>

<h3 id="Why-“code-ronin”"><a href="#Why-“code-ronin”" class="headerlink" title="Why “code ronin”?"></a>Why “code ronin”?</h3><p>Well, I don’t have formal superior education, but I in my skill bars “self-taught” is overpowered. I am a tech guy with ninja skills.</p>
<hr>

<h3 id="But-what-is-your-goal"><a href="#But-what-is-your-goal" class="headerlink" title="But what is your goal?"></a>But what is your goal?</h3><p>My goal is to grow as an IT guy creating business that delivers well-crafted services from business planning to software architecture and programming. I know most think that you should specialize as a people manager or specialist, I think it is possible to have a specialist heart and eyes for business and let every half of the brain process each one.</p>
<p>I need two things to be motivated with one goal: challenge and rewards. Self-indulgence bothers me, I do not want to do more of the same, that explains the challenge. And achieving a goal that has no merit does not create energy, that explains the rewardss.</p>
<hr>

<h3 id="What-do-you-know"><a href="#What-do-you-know" class="headerlink" title="What do you know?"></a>What do you know?</h3><p>I am always learning and one of the things I like most is learning about new subjects and technologies.</p>
<h4 id="Javascript-NodeJS"><a href="#Javascript-NodeJS" class="headerlink" title="Javascript/NodeJS"></a>Javascript/NodeJS</h4><p>I’m a Javascript lover especially when we’re talking about backend. I have vast knowledge about NodeJS and have already worked with Angular 2, but currently my choice and knowledge for front-end is React. By the projects I have in GitHub you can observe my activity and maturity on the JS world.</p>
<h4 id="Cloud"><a href="#Cloud" class="headerlink" title="Cloud"></a>Cloud</h4><p>I worked hard with Google Cloud and Azure and a little contact with AWS, but none of the cloud providers is a mystery. I consider it simply a demand of the project and I can deal with anyone because the principles of the products are always the same. I have a lot of experience with Kubernetes both managed and self-hosted. Not to mention: yes, I have a lot of experience with Docker and Docker Swarm as well.</p>
<h4 id="Infrastructure"><a href="#Infrastructure" class="headerlink" title="Infrastructure"></a>Infrastructure</h4><p>Here I think my main advantage lies in the in-depth knowledge of Linux. I’ve never been a developer that was restricted to development, I’ve always been to the end of the deployment. I know how to handle monitoring, log management, control and security policies, IaC (infrastructure as code), and so on.</p>
<h4 id="Database"><a href="#Database" class="headerlink" title="Database"></a>Database</h4><p>I have worked a lot with Postgres in all aspects, from the infrastructure to a very broad knowledge of the SQL world. Like every NodeJS lover, I have a lot of experience with MongoDB. I have in my heart the entire Elastic stack (the same level of Postgres, in terms of infrastructure and usage). Another passion of mine and vast knowledge is Redis (or KeyDB).s</p>
<h4 id="Linux"><a href="#Linux" class="headerlink" title="Linux"></a>Linux</h4><p>My world is Linux, especially on distros based on Debian. Shell scripting is very comfortable for me. The entire Linux ecosystem from OS architecture to the implementation of environments are in my domain.</p>
<h4 id="Architecture"><a href="#Architecture" class="headerlink" title="Architecture"></a>Architecture</h4><p>I have worked with monoliths, microservices and SCS (self-contained systems). Of course, as you might imagine, today I prefer to work with SOA soon my mindset is for microservices and SCS. Domain the subjects involved as: event-sourcing, CQRS, HA, DDD, synchronous and asynchronous communication and so on.</p>
<p>Once again, in my GitHub you can understand about my domain on this topic.</p>
<hr>

<h3 id="What’s-your-experience"><a href="#What’s-your-experience" class="headerlink" title="What’s your experience?"></a>What’s your experience?</h3><p>My professional experience goes far beyond the scope of the companies I worked for, however below I present my professional support to the companies I worked with.</p>
<h4 id="Dasa"><a href="#Dasa" class="headerlink" title="Dasa"></a>Dasa</h4><p>I assumed the position of SRE (site reliability engineer) being responsible for developing, sustaining and creating automatic strategies for monitoring, self-healing as well as planning the technological evolution of the Cloud, Continuous Integration, Continous Delivery (and Deployment) for all company squads assisting them in the development and maintenance of their applications.</p>
<h4 id="BTG-Pactual"><a href="#BTG-Pactual" class="headerlink" title="BTG Pactual"></a>BTG Pactual</h4><p>At BTG I took the position of software architect developing internal product projects related to systems monitoring and data science, all platforms in microservice architecture in high availability. The main technology used was NodeJS along with Docker, Elasticsearch and Redis. I worked from the planning requirements analysis, development to the implementation of the demands, the main project on my responsibility is extremely critical as it creates visibility into the bank’s systems.</p>
<h4 id="Quata-Investimentos"><a href="#Quata-Investimentos" class="headerlink" title="Quatá Investimentos"></a>Quatá Investimentos</h4><p>I worked directly with the core business of the company. In direct contact with the financial market, responsible for managing the entire software development of the company. Comprehensive understanding of financial asset management, credit systems, collection and fund management. Taking into account end-to-end development (front and back), reaching the goals of the company for the implementation of software solutions and client applications.</p>
<h4 id="Live-eCommerce"><a href="#Live-eCommerce" class="headerlink" title="Live eCommerce"></a>Live eCommerce</h4><p>Developed the company platform. Aimed at SaaS sales for online trading. Entered as a developer, achieved team leadership, and then became the company’s CTO.</p>

<h3 id="What-you-don’t-want-to-learn"><a href="#What-you-don’t-want-to-learn" class="headerlink" title="What you don’t want to learn?"></a>What you don’t want to learn?</h3><p>Because our life span is limited, we have to dedicate our time to what we want and dream about. The list below does not say what I do not like, it just says about what I do not want to take time to learn:</p>
<ul>
<li>Java</li>
<li>Ruby</li>
<li>Python</li>
<li>IBM, Microsoft and Oracle entreprise things</li>
</ul>
<hr>

<h3 id="Are-you-evaluating-new-opportunities"><a href="#Are-you-evaluating-new-opportunities" class="headerlink" title="Are you evaluating new opportunities?"></a>Are you evaluating new opportunities?</h3><p>I am always evaluating new opportunities, for business, projects, job vacancies. Just remember what I said about my profile: challenge and rewards. Not “I trade six for a half dozen,” an opportunity always has to be better than my current situation.</p>
<p>Of course, for open-source projects we have our personal motivations and not necessarily you need to show me that it’s worth, I discover the value of the solution understanding the project proposal.</p>
